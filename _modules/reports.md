== About Reports ==

Reports are accessed by clicking on the Project from within the Project Queue (List) and are located in the upper left set of buttons.

This is a detailed time sheet/report created from task logs for a particular project. You can Select the date range for the report, as well as all users or a particular user, All tasks or particular tasks (sets of tasks). The report will output to a CSV file or a PDF File.

== Hour Summary Report ==
Shows total hours for each user. This report shows total hours for each user on the selected project. You can select the date range for the report as well as nominate the user (or all users) and generate the output as a PDF or a CSV file.

== Tasks Sorted by User ==
This report shows the tasks allocated to users. You can select all or an individual user, nominate the date range and indicate the number of task levels (parent / child tasks). This report also allows you to include all projects in the database, and display allocated hours/weeks.

This report shows tasks end dates (real and theoretical). You can select the range, the user name and whether or not you wish to include all active projects. There are no alternative output options.

This report lists tasks to be completed in the next week. Selecting this report will automatically generate a PDF file.

== User performance ==
This report that shows the amount of hours worked by a user against those allocated in tasks. You will be able to nominate a date range, whether or not to include all projects and whether or not to include all tasks (regardless of date / status). User efficiency is based around a users actual vs estimated times. If the user performs the work in less time than that defined for the task they will be more than 100% effective. If they take longer, then they will be less than 100% effective.

You can also nominate a value against these, for example making the value 2 and then selecting Previous Month would show the previous 2 months.
