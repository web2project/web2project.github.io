## Module Overview

The links module is an alternative resource where you can store quick links for reference and assign them to [[projects]] or [[task]].

This is particularly useful to store client or vendor websites, but can be used for a number of purposes including links to external project files.

== Contacts List View (Links Index) ==

The links index page contains a number of tabs which can be defined via the system administration > Lookup Values. These tabs are used primarily to help you categorize all of your link resources so you can access them quickly.

For each tab there is a table which contains a list of available links along with usefull information about the link.

From this page you can:

*Add a new link
*View existing links
*Edit a link.
*View the project the link(s) are assigned to
*View a short description
*View the category
*View the task (if any)
*View who owns the links
*View the date and time the link was added.

== Links Add/Edit (Links addedit) ==
